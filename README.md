# üí∏ Crypto Tracker

**Description:**  
Crypto Tracker is a React web app that brings real-time cryptocurrency data to your fingertips. Users can explore price, market cap, percent change, and other details for dozens of cryptocurrencies. Each coin has its own detail page with additional information and price history, while a search bar lets users quickly find coins by symbol. Built using the CryptoCompare API, the app is lightweight, informative, and easy to use.
