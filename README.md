# 💸 Crypto Tracker

**Crypto Tracker** is a React-based web app that displays real-time cryptocurrency data. Users can explore price, market cap, and other details for dozens of cryptocurrencies, and use the search functionality to find a specific coin by its symbol. Built using the CryptoCompare API, the app is a lightweight tracker with both utility and educational value.

This app gives users quick insight into the ever-shifting world of cryptocurrencies. Leveraging the CryptoCompare API, it fetches live data and displays key stats like value, percent change, and market cap. Users can search for any coin in the displayed list using its symbol.
